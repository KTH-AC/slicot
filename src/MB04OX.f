C
C     PURPOSE
C
C     To perform the QR factorization
C
C        (U ) = Q*(R),
C        (x')     (0)
C
C     where U and R are n-by-n upper triangular matrices, x is an
C     n element vector and Q is an (n+1)-by-(n+1) orthogonal matrix.
C
C     U must be supplied in the n-by-n upper triangular part of the
C     array A and this is overwritten by R.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N      (input) INTEGER
C            The number of elements of X and the order of the square
C            matrix A.  N >= 0.
C
C     A      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
C            On entry, the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this
C            array must contain the upper triangular matrix U.
C            On exit, the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this
C            array contains the upper triangular matrix R.
C            The strict lower triangle of A is not referenced.
C
C     LDA    INTEGER
C            The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
C
C     X      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
C            (1+(N-1)*INCX)
C            On entry, the incremented array X must contain the
C            vector x. On exit, the content of X is changed.
C
C     INCX   (input) INTEGER.
C            Specifies the increment for the elements of X.  INCX > 0.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The matrix Q is formed as a sequence of plane rotations in planes
C     (1, n+1), (2, n+1), ..., (n, n+1), the rotation in the (j, n+1)th
C     plane, Q(j), being chosen to annihilate the jth element of x.
