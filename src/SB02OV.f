C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     ALPHAR  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The real part of the numerator of the current eigenvalue
C             considered.
C
C     ALPHAI  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The imaginary part of the numerator of the current
C             eigenvalue considered.
C
C     BETA    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The (real) denominator of the current eigenvalue
C             considered.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The function value SB02OV is set to .TRUE. for an unstable
C     eigenvalue (i.e., with modulus greater than or equal to one) and
C     to .FALSE., otherwise.
