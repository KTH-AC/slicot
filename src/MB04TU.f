C     PURPOSE
C
C     To perform the Givens transformation, defined by C (cos) and S
C     (sin), and interchange the vectors involved, i.e.
C
C        |X(i)|    | 0   1 |   | C   S |   |X(i)|
C        |    | := |       | x |       | x |    |, i = 1,...N.
C        |Y(i)|    | 1   0 |   |-S   C |   |Y(i)|
C
C     REMARK. This routine is a modification of DROT from BLAS.
C             This routine is called only by the SLICOT routines MB04TX
C             and MB04VX.
C
C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
C
C     The algorithm is backward stable.
