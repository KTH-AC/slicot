C     PURPOSE
C
C     To construct a complex plane rotation such that, for a complex
C     number  a  and a real number  b,
C
C        ( conjg( c )  s )*( a ) = ( d ),
C        (       -s    c ) ( b )   ( 0 )
C
C     where  d  is always real and is overwritten on  a,  so that on
C     return the imaginary part of  a  is zero.  b  is unaltered.
C
C     This routine has A and C declared as REAL, because it is intended
C     for use within a real Lyapunov solver and the REAL declarations
C     mean that a standard Fortran DOUBLE PRECISION version may be
C     readily constructed.  However A and C could safely be declared
C     COMPLEX in the calling program, although some systems may give a
C     type mismatch warning.

C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2)
C             On entry, A(1) and A(2) must contain the real and
C             imaginary part, respectively, of the complex number a.
C             On exit, A(1) contains the real part of d, and A(2) is
C             set to zero.
C
C     B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The real number b.
C
C     C       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2)
C             C(1) and C(2) contain the real and imaginary part,
C             respectively, of the complex number c, the cosines of
C             the plane rotation.
C
C     S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The real number s, the sines of the plane rotation.
