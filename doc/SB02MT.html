<PRE>
  To compute the following matrices

             -1
      G = B*R  *B',

      -          -1
      A = A - B*R  *L',

      -          -1
      Q = Q - L*R  *L',

  where A, B, Q, R, L, and G are N-by-N, N-by-M, N-by-N, M-by-M,
  N-by-M, and N-by-N matrices, respectively, with Q, R and G
  symmetric matrices.

  When R is well-conditioned with respect to inversion, standard
  algorithms for solving linear-quadratic optimization problems will
  then also solve optimization problems with coupling weighting
  matrix L. Moreover, a gain in efficiency is possible using matrix
  G in the deflating subspace algorithms (see SLICOT Library routine
  SB02OD).
